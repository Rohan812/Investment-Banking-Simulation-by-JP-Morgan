#### Background Info. ####

The WorldWide Brewing Co. CEO emailed your Managing Director with a last-minute business concern and asked for our revised investment recommendation. There was a small fire in one of HappyHour Co's beer packaging plants.

The CEO sends a follow-up email with the below information:

Expected financial impact of facility fire in FY21

* FY21E revenue of $1,100mm (down ~4-5% )
* 50% gross margin 
* Management expects to revert to originally forecasted sales in FY22 and thereafter

In addition, as you are reading the morning news, you come across a report saying one of WorldWide Co’s competitors is prepared to bid over $650mm for the target asset.

New factors to consider:

* Financial impact of supply chain interruption
* Bidding dynamics
